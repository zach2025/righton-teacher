# RightOn! Mock Teacher Projection Web App
## Description
This is a React web app which serves as a mockup of the teacher projection web app. You can switch between three different pages: the join page, the question page, and the leaderboard page. To switch between these, simply click the button on the page and it will advance you to the next page (with the exception of the leaderboard which takes you back to the join page). Let me know how I can improve upon this; refactoring, styling, or otherwise. Enjoy!!!

Note: The gamecode input box does NOT function, so do NOT submit any text as it will not direct you to a new page. It is currently there as a proof of concept.

## Installing libraries
In order to get the app working you need to install a few libraries. Run the following commands after you have changed directories to this project in your command line interface:
### `npm install`
### `npm install react-router-dom`

After installing both, you can run `npm start` and it will open up a local server hosting the web app
